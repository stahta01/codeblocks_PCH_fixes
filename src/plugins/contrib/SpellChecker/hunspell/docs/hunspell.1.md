# hunspell(1) -- spell checker, stemmer and morphological analyzer

## SYNOPSIS

    hunspell [-1aDGHhLlmnOrstvwX]  [--check-url] [--check-apostrophe]
             [-d dict[,dict2,...]] [--help] [-i enc] [-p dict] [-vv] [--version]
             [<text/OpenDocument/TeX/LaTeX/HTML/SGML/XML/nroff/troff file(s)>]

## DESCRIPTION

Hunspell is fashioned after the Ispell program. The most common usage is
`hunspell` or `hunspell <filename>`. Without filename parameter,
hunspell checks the standard input. Typing `cat` and `exsample` in two
input lines, results an asterisk (it means `cat` is a correct word) and
a line with corrections:

    $ hunspell -d en_US
    Hunspell 1.2.3
    *
    & exsample 4 0: example, examples, ex sample, ex-sample

Correct words signed with an `*`, `+` or `-`, unrecognized words signed
with `#` or `&` in output lines (see later). (Close the standard input
with Ctrl-d on Unix/Linux and Ctrl-Z Enter or Ctrl-C on Windows.)

With filename parameters, hunspell will display each word of the files
which does not appear in the dictionary at the top of the screen and
allow you to change it. If there are "near misses" in the dictionary,
then they are also displayed on following lines. Finally, the line
containing the word and the previous line are printed at the bottom of
the screen. If your terminal can display in reverse video, the word
itself is highlighted. You have the option of replacing the word
completely, or choosing one of the suggested words. Commands are single
characters as follows (case is ignored):

  - R:
    Replace the misspelled word completely.

  - Space:
    Accept the word this time only.

  - A:
    Accept the word for the rest of this hunspell session.

  - I:
    Accept the word, capitalized as it is in the file, and update
    private dictionary.

  - U:
    Accept the word, and add an uncapitalized (actually, all
    lower-case) version to the private dictionary.

  - S:
    Ask a stem and a model word and store them in the private
    dictionary. The stem will be accepted also with the affixes of the
    model word.

  - 0-n:
    Replace with one of the suggested words.

  - X:
    Write the rest of this file, ignoring misspellings, and start
    next file.

  - Q:
    Exit immediately and leave the file unchanged.

  - ^Z:
    Suspend hunspell.

  - ?:
    Give help screen.

## OPTIONS

  - `-1`:
    Check only first field in lines (delimiter = tabulator).

  - `-a`:
    The -a option is intended to be used from other programs
    through a pipe.

  - `--check-apostrophe`:
    Check and force Unicode apostrophes (U+2019),
    if one of the ASCII or Unicode apostrophes is specified by the
    spelling dictionary, as a word character (see WORDCHARS, ICONV and
    OCONV in hunspell(5)).

  - `--check-url`:
    Check URLs, e-mail addresses and directory paths.

  - `-D`:
    Show detected path of the loaded dictionary, and list of the
    search path and the available dictionaries.

  - `-d <dict>,<dict2>,...`:
    Set dictionaries by their base names with
    or without paths. Example of the syntax:

    `-d en_US,en_geo,en_med,de_DE,de_med`

    `en_US` and `de_DE` are base dictionaries, they consist of aff and
    dic file pairs: `en_US.aff, en_US.dic` and `de_DE.aff, de_DE.dic`.
    `En_geo, en_med, de_med` are special dictionaries: dictionaries
    without affix file. Special dictionaries are optional extension of
    the base dictionaries usually with special (medical, law etc.)
    terms. There is no naming convention for special dictionaries, only
    the ".dic" extension: dictionaries without affix file will be an
    extension of the preceding base dictionary (right order of the
    parameter list needs for good suggestions). First item of -d
    parameter list must be a base dictionary.

  - `-G`:
    Print only correct words or lines.

  - `-H`:
    The input file is in SGML/HTML format.

  - `-h, --help`:
    Short help.

  - `-i`:
    enc Set input encoding.

  - `-L`:
    Print lines with misspelled words.

  - `-l`:
    The "list" option is used to produce a list of misspelled
    words from the standard input.

  - `-m`:
    Analyze the words of the input text (see also hunspell(5)
    about morphological analysis). Without dictionary morphological
    data, signs the flags of the affixes of the word forms for
    dictionary developers.

  - `-n`:
    The input file is in nroff/troff format.

  - `-O`:
    The input file is in OpenDocument (ODF or Flat ODF) format. If
    unzip program is not installed, install it before using this option.

  - `-P <password>`:
    Set password for encrypted dictionaries.

  - `-p <dict>`:
    Set path of personal dictionary. The default dictionary
    depends on the locale settings. The following environment variables
    are searched: `LC_ALL`, `LC_MESSAGES`, and `LANG`. If none are set
    then the default personal dictionary is `$HOME/.hunspell_default`.

    Setting -d or the DICTIONARY environmental variable, personal
    dictionary will be `$HOME/.hunspell_dicname`

  - `-r`:
    Warn of the rare words, which are also potential spelling
    mistakes.

  - `-s`:
    Stem the words of the input text (see also hunspell(5) about
    stemming). It depends from the dictionary data.

  - `-t`:
    The input file is in TeX or LaTeX format.

  - `-v, --version`:
    Print version number.

  - `-vv`:
    Print ispell(1) compatible version number.

  - `-w`:
    Print misspelled words (= lines) from one word/line input.

  - `-X`:
    The input file is in XML format.

## Pipe Mode

In this mode (`-a`), hunspell prints a one-line version
identification message, and then begins reading lines of input. For
each input line, a single line is written to the standard output for
each word checked for spelling on the line. If the word was found in
the main dictionary, or your personal dictionary, then the line
contains only a `*`. If the word was found through affix removal,
then the line contains a `+`, a space, and the root word. If the
word was found through compound formation (concatenation of two
words, then the line contains only a `-`.

If the word is not in the dictionary, but there are near misses,
then the line contains an `&`, a space, the misspelled word, a
space, the number of near misses, the number of characters between
the beginning of the line and the beginning of the misspelled word,
a colon, another space, and a list of the near misses separated by
commas and spaces.

Also, each near miss or guess is capitalized the same as the input
word unless such capitalization is illegal; in the latter case each
near miss is capitalized correctly according to the dictionary.

Finally, if the word does not appear in the dictionary, and there
are no near misses, then the line contains a `#`, a space, the
misspelled word, a space, and the character offset from the
beginning of the line. Each sentence of text input is terminated
with an additional blank line, indicating that hunspell has
completed processing the input line.

These output lines can be summarized as follows:

  - OK:
    `*`
  - Root:
    `+ <root>`
  - Compound:
    `-`
  - Miss:
    `& <original> <count> <offset>: <miss>, <miss>, ...`
  - None:
    `# <original> <offset>`

For example, a dummy dictionary containing the words "fray", "Frey",
"fry", and "refried" might produce the following response to the
command "echo 'frqy refries | hunspell -a":

    (#) Hunspell 0.4.1 (beta), 2005-05-26
    & frqy 3 0: fray, Frey, fry
    & refries 1 5: refried

This mode is also suitable for interactive use when you want to
figure out the spelling of a single word (but this is the default
behavior of hunspell without -a, too).

When in the -a mode, hunspell will also accept lines of single words
prefixed with any of `*`, `&`, `@`, `+`, `-`, `~`, `#`, `!`, `%`,
`` ` ``, or `^`. A line starting with `*` tells hunspell to insert
the word into the user's dictionary (similar to the I command). A
line starting with `&` tells hunspell to insert an all-lowercase
version of the word into the user's dictionary (similar to the U
command). A line starting with `@` causes hunspell to accept this
word in the future (similar to the A command). A line starting with
`+`, followed immediately by tex or nroff will cause hunspell to
parse future input according the syntax of that formatter. A line
consisting solely of a `+` will place hunspell in TeX/LaTeX mode
(similar to the -t option) and `-` returns hunspell to nroff/troff
mode (but these commands are obsolete). However, the string
character type is not changed; the `~` command must be used to do
this. A line starting with `~` causes hunspell to set internal
parameters (in particular, the default string character type) based
on the filename given in the rest of the line. (A file suffix is
sufficient, but the period must be included. Instead of a file name
or suffix, a unique name, as listed in the language affix file, may
be specified.) However, the formatter parsing is not changed; the
`+` command must be used to change the formatter. A line prefixed
with `#` will cause the personal dictionary to be saved. A line
prefixed with `!` will turn on terse mode (see below), and a line
prefixed with `%` will return hunspell to normal (non-terse) mode. A
line prefixed with `` ` `` will turn on verbose-correction mode (see
below); this mode can only be disabled by turning on terse mode with
`%`.

Any input following the prefix characters `+`, `-`, `#`, `!`, `%`,
or `` ` `` is ignored, as is any input following the filename on a
`~` line. To allow spell-checking of lines beginning with these
characters, a line starting with `^` has that character removed
before it is passed to the spell-checking code. It is recommended
that programmatic interfaces prefix every data line with an uparrow
to protect themselves against future changes in hunspell.

To summarize these:

  - `*`:
    Add to personal dictionary
  - `@`:
    Accept word, but leave out of dictionary
  - `#`:
    Save current personal dictionary
  - `~`:
    Set parameters based on filename
  - `+`:
    Enter TeX mode
  - `-`:
    Exit TeX mode
  - `!`:
    Enter terse mode
  - `%`:
    Exit terse mode
  - `` ` ``:
    Enter verbose-correction mode
  - `^`:
    Spell-check rest of line

In terse mode, hunspell will not print lines beginning with `*`,
`+`, or `-`, all of which indicate correct words. This significantly
improves running speed when the driving program is going to ignore
correct words anyway.

In verbose-correction mode, hunspell includes the original word
immediately after the indicator character in output lines beginning
with `*`, `+`, and `-`, which simplifies interaction for some
programs.

    Interactive spell checking of ODF documents.

  - `hunspell -l *.odt`:
    List bad words of ODF documents

  - `hunspell -l *.odt | sort | uniq >unrecognized`:
    Saving unrecognized
    words of ODF documents (filtering duplications).

  - `hunspell -p unrecognized_but_good *.odt`:
    Interactive spell
    checking of ODF documents, using the previously saved and reduced

## ENVIRONMENT

  - DICTIONARY:
    Similar to -d.

  - DICPATH:
    Dictionary path.

  - WORDLIST:
    Equivalent to -p.

## FILES

The default dictionary depends on the locale settings. The following
environment variables are searched: LC\_ALL, LC\_MESSAGES, and LANG. If
none are set then the following fallbacks are used:

`/usr/share/myspell/default.aff` Path of default affix file. See
hunspell(5).

`/usr/share/myspell/default.dic` Path of default dictionary file. See
hunspell(5).

`$HOME/.hunspell_default`. Default path to personal dictionary.
